This is what I will do:

  1. delete data from all your tables
  2. \copy Students from '/u1/junk/cs457/Bonus/students2.csv' delimiter ':' csv;
  3. select * from credits;
  4. \copy Courses from '/u1/junk/cs457/Bonus/courses2.csv' delimiter ':' csv;
  5. check the Courses table
  6. \copy Grades from '/u1/junk/cs457/Bonus/grades.csv' delimiter ':' csv;
  7. look at Credits, Probation, etc.
  8. query: credit hours and average grade by course (coursequery)
  9. query: credit hours and average grade by department (deptquery)
